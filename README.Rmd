<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ismisc is to provide me with the functions that I use frequently.

## Installation


```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ismailmuller/ismisc")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# require(ismisc)
# 
# split_file_into(iris, out_file = "iris_splitted.xlsx", split_by = "Species", into = "sheets")
# file.exists("iris_splitted.xlsx")
```
